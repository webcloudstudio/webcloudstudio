  # or: pipx install drydock-sdd
  ```

- **Do not:** reinstall during the take
- **Visible proof:** version + sanitized configuration + Target list
- **Cut point:** command output stable on screen

## Clip 07 — S: Initialize the Target

- **Length:** 40–60 seconds
- **Scene:** terminal, then editor file tree
- **Command shape:**

  ```bash
  drydock init <Target> --display-name "<Display Name>" --description "<Description>"
  drydock status <Target>
  ```

- **Talking points:**
  - Target — governed workspace for one project

  - Target artifacts separate from generated application
  - QuarterDeck configuration created with the Target
- **Screen actions:**
  - Prefer prepared Target
  - Show equivalent command; do not recreate live
  - Expand Target root
  - Show `METADATA.md`, Compass files, `blueprint/`, `QuarterDeck/`
- **Recovery:**

## Clip 08 — A: Import Source Material

- **Length:** 55–75 seconds
- **Scene:** editor, then terminal
- **Command shape:**

  ```bash
  drydock import <Target> <Source> --format markdown
  ```

- **Talking points:**
  - Input can begin as Markdown, source, Spec Kit, Compass, or intent material
  - Imported source preserved under Drydock control

  - No `BLOCKERS.md` — planning may proceed
- **Edit:** remove model wait; retain command start and completion summary

## Clip 10 — A: Commander Review in QuarterDeck

- **Length:** 75–90 seconds
- **Scene:** QuarterDeck browser
- **Command:**

  ```bash
  drydock run quarterdeck <Target>

  - Show one dependent block
  - Trace `depends:` edge
  - Show pending / buildable / verified state
  - Show grouping or cost signal in QuarterDeck
- **Anchor:**
  - “The Blueprint is authority; the Manifest is execution.”
- **Transition:**
  - “Implement walks only the runnable frontier.”

## Clip 14 — I: Build One Frontier

- **Length:** 65–90 seconds
- **Scene:** terminal invocation; hard cut; editor and terminal result
- **Command:**

  ```bash
  drydock build <Target>
  ```

- **Before-command points:**
  - One runnable step or grouped block
  - Provider CLI performs real implementation work
  - Module writes controlled outputs
  - Evidence persists outside the model response
- **After-command proof:**
  - Manifest state transition
  - generated or changed application files
  - matching test file
  - execution evidence directory
  - updated build status
- **Commands after completion:**

  ```bash
  drydock build status <Target>
  ```

- **Avoid:** terminal progress as the proof
- **Core proof:** code + test + Manifest state + evidence
- **Recovery:** live provider failure — show previously completed block and recorded evidence; state “completed run”

## Clip 15 — I: Verify Acceptance and Evidence

- **Length:** 65–85 seconds
- **Scene:** terminal, then QuarterDeck or editor
- **Commands:**

  ```bash
  drydock score ac <Target>
  drydock score release <Target>
  ```

- **Talking points:**
  - Story acceptance — deterministic Programmatic Acceptance
  - Soundings — per-criterion state and evidence
  - Sea Trials — product-level objectives
  - Release score — release-readiness evaluation
  - Proof integrity — passing test must actually prove behavior
- **Screen actions:**
  - Run or show completed `score ac`
  - Open `SOUNDINGS.md`
  - Trace one criterion to evidence
  - Open `SCORECARD.md`
  - Show pass / fail / unverified distinctions
- **Avoid:** claiming an alpha score equals production certification
- **Transition:**
  - “Artifacts prove the process; the application proves the result.”

## Clip 16 — I: Run the Working Application

- **Length:** 75–90 seconds
- **Scene:** application browser; optional terminal inset
- **Talking points:**
  - Same Target
  - Same Blueprint
  - Same Manifest execution
  - Working behavior, not generated text
- **Screen route:**
  - Health endpoint or startup proof
  - Primary application screen
  - One feature from the demonstrated Blueprint
  - One edge case or validation path
- **Traceability beat:**
  - Feature behavior on screen
  - Corresponding Blueprint criterion
  - Corresponding automated test
- **Visual priority:** application full screen
- **Avoid:** broad product tour of the demo application
- **Cut point:** successful feature result held for two beats

## Clip 17 — Cross-Cutting: Rigging and Context Control

- **Length:** 55–75 seconds
- **Scene:** editor split view
- **Talking points:**
  - Rigging — portfolio governance
  - Business rules
  - stack guidance
  - branding
  - standard templates
  - Full context for a builder
  - Compact interface context for a consumer
  - Less irrelevant context in downstream work
- **Screen actions:**
  - Show `Rigging/` categories
  - Show one full file beside compact derivative
  - Highlight interfaces retained; rationale removed
- **Optional command:**

  ```bash
  drydock rigging compact <Target>
  drydock rigging verify <Target>
  ```

- **Anchor:**
  - “Context is selected by role, not accumulated by habit.”

## Clip 18 — L: Refit a Controlled Change

- **Length:** 75–90 seconds
- **Scene:** editor, QuarterDeck, terminal
- **Talking points:**
  - First build — beginning of ownership
  - Two governed change inputs
    - changed Blueprint
    - change ticket under `blueprint/changes/`
  - Ticket `Amends:` — parent Blueprint relationship
  - Refit — dependency impact + Manifest reset
  - Normal build path reused
- **Screen actions:**
  - Open prepared `<Ticket>`
  - Show intent
  - Show `Amends:` target
  - Show changed or reset Manifest block
- **Commands:**

  ```bash
  drydock refit <Target>
  drydock build status <Target>
  drydock build <Target>
  ```

- **Do not:** author an untested ticket live
- **Core claim:** change enters the graph; change does not bypass the process
- **Transition:**
  - “The same acceptance path now proves the changed product.”

## Clip 19 — L: Prove the Change

- **Length:** 55–80 seconds
- **Scene:** tests, application, and Manifest state
- **Talking points:**
  - Changed behavior visible
  - Existing behavior still verified
  - Ticket tied to specification authority
  - Impacted graph path rebuilt
  - Unaffected work preserved
- **Proof sequence:**
  - Focused test
  - full project test summary
  - changed application behavior
  - Manifest verified state

  - Generated software still requires normal security, testing, and operational review
- **Invitation:**
  - Install
  - build a small real Target
  - report issues with reproducible artifacts
  - contribute Rigging for tested stacks
- **Transition:** return to deck slide 5

## Clip 21 — Closer: Take It for a Sail

- **Length:** 35–55 seconds
- **Scene:** deck slide 5; optional talking-head inset
- **Closer beats:**
  - Drydock claim — process layer for SDD
  - Proof shown
    - source material
    - Commander review
    - Blueprint authority
    - Manifest execution
    - working software
    - verified change
  - Current truth — implemented alpha, evolving contracts
  - Single ask — try one real project; report the voyage
- **Links on screen:**
  - <https://webcloudstudio.com/>
  - <https://github.com/webcloudstudio/Drydock>
- **Closing line:**
  - “Own the specification. Steer the build. Take it for a sail.”
- **End:** two silent beats on links; no extra sign-off

  - “This Target is prepared so the walkthrough can focus on the artifacts.”
- Command already completed
  - “Here is the persisted result from that run.”
- Live provider failure
  - “The provider run failed; Drydock preserved the failure evidence and left the work reviewable.”
- Application startup delay
  - “The application is already running in the prepared browser session.”
- Unexpected UI state
  - “The underlying Markdown artifact remains the record; I will show it directly.”

## Claims to Avoid

- Deterministic model output
- Fully autonomous software delivery
- Production readiness from a passing build alone
- Universal stack support
- Stable command contracts before `1.0`
- Zero human review
- Zero drift
- Guaranteed lower total cost
